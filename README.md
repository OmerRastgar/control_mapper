A Control Mapper for Git is a tool or framework designed to align security, compliance, and governance controls with Git repositories and workflows. It maps organizational policies, industry standards, and regulatory requirements (such as ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS, SOC 2) to Git-based version control activities.

Key Functions of a Control Mapper for Git
Policy Mapping & Compliance

Maps security and compliance controls to Git actions (e.g., commits, merges, pull requests).
Ensures adherence to organizational security policies by enforcing specific requirements for code changes.
Access Control & Identity Management

Maps user roles and permissions to Git repository actions.
Ensures that only authorized personnel can push code, merge changes, or modify sensitive repositories.
Change Tracking & Audit Logging

Maps audit trails to Git events such as commit history, branch merges, and tag creations.
Provides visibility into changes for forensic investigations and compliance audits.
Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Enforcement

Maps SDLC controls (e.g., code reviews, automated security scanning) to Git-based workflows.
Ensures that code changes go through proper security checks before deployment.
Risk Assessment & Monitoring

Identifies potential security risks by mapping controls to suspicious Git activities (e.g., force pushes, direct commits to protected branches).
Monitors for unauthorized changes or policy violations.
Integration with DevSecOps Tools

Links with CI/CD pipelines, static/dynamic security testing (SAST/DAST), and secret scanning tools.
Enforces security policies within Git workflows by integrating automated checks before merges.
Use Cases
ISO 27001 Compliance: Mapping Annex A controls to Git workflows, such as change management and access control.
PCI DSS Compliance: Ensuring secure software development practices and auditability of code changes.
SOC 2 Audits: Tracking code changes and ensuring only authorized updates reach production.
